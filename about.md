This course intends to provide a thorough modern introduction to the field of machine learning. It is designed for students who want to understand not only what machine learning algorithms do and how they can be used, but also the fundamental principles behind how and why they work.

## Format

Lectures will be held live every Tuesday and Thursday during 1:45-3:15 pm. Office hours will be held throughout the week. The time and location will be posted soon.

We will not be recording the lectures, so we highly encourage attending them live. Lecture notes and slides will be made available after the lecture. If you miss class, we encourage you to attend office hours.

## Prerequisites

- Undergraduate level training or coursework on linear algebra, (multivariate) calculus, and basic probability and statistics,

- Basic programming in Python,

- Undergraduate level training or coursework in the analysis of algorithms.


## Resources 

We will not be explicitly following any single textbook in this course. The following books are useful for supplementary reading.

- Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman. Available as PDF [https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf](here).

- Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction by Kevin Murphy. Available as PDF [https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html](here).

- Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms, by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. Available as PDF [https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf](here). Refer to this book for a more theoretical exposition of the material covered in class.

## Grading

Your grade will be based on three components: **Homeworks 50% (HW0:Required (not graded), HW1-HW5: 10% each); Midterm 20%; Final 30%**.

### Homeworks

Homeworks will be posted on Mondays, every two weeks except for the week of the midterm. They will be due on the Friday the week after they have been released. Grades will be made available within 10 days of the deadline. Your homeworks will be submitted via Gradescope. Coding will be in Python. Written homeworks should be submitted in Latex. A template will be made available with the homework. Each student will have **144 cumulative hours (6 days)** of late time (as measured on Canvas), which will be forgiven. After this cumulative amount of time has passed, any assignment that is turned in late will receive zero credit. Furthermore, only up to 48 hours (2 days) of late time may be used on any one assignment; any assignment turned in more than 48 hours late will receive zero credit. 

### Exams

There will be two exams: (1) a Midterm exam to be held on February 21, 2023 during the lecture, and (2) a Final exam to be held in May (date/time TBA).

## Collaboration

Collaboration is permitted and encouraged, though each student must understand, write, and hand in their own submission. In particular, it is acceptable for students to discuss problems with each other; it is not acceptable for students to look at another student's written answers when writing their own. It is also not acceptable to publicly post your (partial) solution on Ed, but it is is encouraged for you to ask public questions on Ed. If you choose to collaborate, you must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated.

## Honor Code

The purpose of homeworks is to help you get a deeper understanding of the course material and practice with applying the concepts learned in class, not just give us the right answers. You are encouraged to use online resources for learning more about the material covered in class; however, you should not look for or use found solutions to questions in the homeworks. This includes any solutions found on the internet to questions in the homework, solutions by a student in a previous class or by a current classmate, and/or by querying ChatGPT. Cheating will be punished according to university regulations as determined by the Office of Student Conduct.
