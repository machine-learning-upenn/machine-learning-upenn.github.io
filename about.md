## Grading

Your grade will be based on three components: **Homeworks 50% (HW0:Required (not graded), HW1-HW5: 10% each); Midterm 20%; Final 30%**.

### Homeworks

Homeworks will be posted on Mondays, every two weeks except for the week of the midterm. They will be due on the Friday the week after they have been released. Grades will be made available within 10 days of the deadline. Your homeworks will be submitted via Gradescope. Coding will be in Python. Written homeworks should be submitted in Latex. A template will be made available with the homework. Each student will have **144 cumulative hours (6 days)** of late time (as measured on Canvas), which will be forgiven. After this cumulative amount of time has passed, any assignment that is turned in late will receive zero credit. Furthermore, only up to 48 hours (2 days) of late time may be used on any one assignment; any assignment turned in more than 48 hours late will receive zero credit. 

### Exams

There will be two exams: (1) a Midterm exam to be held on February 23, 2023 during the lecture, and (2) a Final exam to be held in May (date/time TBA).

## Regrading

If you would like a regrade of an assignment or exam, you must submit your request within 1 week from the date when grades are released. All requests must be made through Ed with a written explanation of the concern. They will not be entertained suring the OHs or lectures.

## Collaboration

Collaboration is permitted and encouraged for homeworks, though each student must understand, write, and hand in their own submission. In particular, it is acceptable for students to discuss problems with each other; it is not acceptable for students to look at another student's written answers when writing their own. It is also not acceptable to publicly post your (partial) solution on Ed, but it is is encouraged for you to ask public questions on Ed. If you choose to collaborate, you must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated. **No collaboration or discussion is allowed for exams.**

## Honor Code

The purpose of homeworks is to help you get a deeper understanding of the course material and practice with applying the concepts learned in class, not just give us the right answers. You are encouraged to use online resources for learning more about the material covered in class; however, you should not look for or use found solutions to questions in the homeworks. This includes any solutions found on the internet to questions in the homework, solutions by a student in a previous class or by a current classmate, and/or by querying ChatGPT. Cheating will be punished according to university regulations as determined by the Office of Student Conduct and the University.

## Masking Policy

For the health and safety of everyone, we are requiring that all students wear a mask during class and office hours. If you are feeling sick, we encourage you to stay at home and recover.
