    "content": "This course intends to provide a thorough modern introduction to the field of machine learning. It is designed for students who want to understand not only what machine learning algorithms do and how they can be used, but also the fundamental principles behind how and why they work. In particular, the course will focus on understanding the theoretical foundations of machine learning methods, along with applying them to real world data. The course schedule contains the tentative schedule including topics we will cover in the lectures and any relevant reading material. Please refer here for the more information on the course along with the course policies. ",

A template will be made available with the homework. Each student will have 144 cumulative hours (6 days) of late time (as measured on Canvas), which will be forgiven. After this cumulative amount of time has passed, any assignment that is turned in late will receive zero credit. Furthermore, only up to 48 hours (2 days) of late time may be used on any one assignment; any assignment turned in more than 48 hours late will receive zero credit. Exams .
